EXPLANATION:
------------

Scenario - script1 is executed

1 - Script1 is being executed

2 - When  scrip1 runs it hits the line importing
script2

3 - Script2 says to import script1 so script1 is
completed where it paused to do script2
as script1 not __main__

4 - That script just reaches pass cuz of the if
statement thing.

5 - Then script 2 is finished and isn't __main__

6 - So that also goes to else:

6 - Python then goes back and finishes script1 as
__main__ because that's what it started with.
